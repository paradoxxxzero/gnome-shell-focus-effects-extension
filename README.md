## Gnome shell focus effects extension

This extension allows you to add custom effects on window focus/blur.
By default it adds a clutter desaturation and an opacity effect.
You can however customize these effects by editing a file named ~/.ffxrc.json and then switching off and on the extension in gnome-tweak-tool.

To install, simply clone this repository and put 'focus-effects@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com/' in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions.
Or you can add it with gnome-tweak-tool.
